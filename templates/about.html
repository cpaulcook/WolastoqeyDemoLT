        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>I acknowledge that the land on which this app was developed
        is the traditional unceded territory of Wolastoqiyik
        (Maliseet). This territory is covered by the Treaties of Peace
        and Friendship which the Wolastoqiyik (Maliseet), Mi'kmaq, and
        Passamaquoddy peoples first signed with the British Crown in
        1725. The treaties did not deal with surrender of lands and
        resources but in fact recognized Wolastoqey (Maliseet),
        Mi'kmaq, and Passamaquoddy title and established the rules for
        what was to be an ongoing relationship between nations.</p>

        <p>This app was developed
        by <a href="http://cs.unb.ca/~ccook1/">Paul Cook</a> as part
        of an assignment
        for <a href="https://www.unb.ca/academics/calendar/undergraduate/current/frederictoncourses/firstnations/abrg-3686.html">ABRG3686
        Wolastoqey Language
        1</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/cpaulcook/WolastoqeyDemoLT">source
        code</a> is freely available.</p>

        <p>This app follows the number system as presented in
        ABRG3686. There are some differences with the information
        presented on
        the <a href="https://pmportal.org/">Passamaquoddy-Maliseet
        Language Portal</a> on the
          <a href="https://pmportal.org/sites/default/files/reference-documents/Numbers.pdf">number
        system</a> (e.g., <em>'cel</em> vs <em>cel</em>).</p>

        <p>Feedback on this app would be very welcome. If you spot
        errors, please let me know. Woliwon!</p>
